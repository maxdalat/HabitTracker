 Stuff to do:
 
 1. Make it so that when you close the app it keeps it's progress [High priority bug]

    3. Even crazier, save it both locally and on a database
 2. Make todos
    1. One time todo's like homework assignments for class and etc.
 3. Just make a database and stop finding ways to avoid it
    1. Using the database, make it possible to see assignments as a example on multiple devices with one leader phone, and other follower;
 4. Possibly try using the chromebook to host the database?

    2. Otherwise use my computer and turn off the; fan lights/replace them
 5. Admin Panel for Database / Admin login
    1. Be careful when uploading to Git
