# HabitTracker

[Made by me, IOS Habit Tracker app with no ads and no reason to do this]

 Stuff to do:
 
 ## 1. Make it so that when you close the app it keeps it's progress DONE YAYAYA
    2. Save it locally DONE
 ## 2. Make it so that when you resetDay(), it brings back the habits that disappeared.
    1. Possible with local savings
 ## 2. Make todos
    1. One time todo's like homework assignments for class and etc.
 ## 3. Just make a database and stop finding ways to avoid it
    1. Using the database, make it possible to see assignments as a example on multiple devices with one leader phone, and other follower;
 ## 4. Possibly try using the chromebook to host the database?
    1. Find out a way to make it always on
    2. Otherwise use my computer and turn off the; fan lights/replace them
 ## 5. Admin Panel for Database / Admin login
    1. Be careful when uploading to Git
 ## 6. Make it possible to add different types of Blocks.
    1. Ex. Todo's, reminders, homework assignments, tests.
 ## 7. Login page
